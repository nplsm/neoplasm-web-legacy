A physical copy of the Marble Bust album, Lifeoxetine, is a MiniDisc with an NFC-tag, which gives access to additional Neoplasm content.

After scanning the NFC-tag, you get:
1. Archive with stems of all compositions from the Lifeoxetine for your remixes.
2. Access to Telegram-bot which shares additional content from the collective.
