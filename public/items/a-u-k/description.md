Each physical embodiment of the release of NEOPLASM becomes not just a carrier of information, but also an object with which user is supposed to actively interact. A physical copy of the Our.v album "A U K" is a jar that contains prescription drug for an individual patient. Inside the jar is a pendant in a form of a pill. Its owner can use the pendant for its intended purpose, as well as an item that has a digital extension. Each aitem is assigned a unique code. The jar contains an NFC tag, which the user scans and receives:

1. Archive with all album tracks + 4 bonus tracks
2. Stems archive of all the tracks for remixing.
3. Access to a private chat in Telegram with label team.

In this chat one can:
- Communicate with other users who have purchased a physical copy.
- Receive promo codes for events.
- Ask questions directly to residents.
- Receive works that do not fall into the main information stream.
