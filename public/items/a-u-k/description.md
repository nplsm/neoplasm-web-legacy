Each physical embodiment of the release of NEOPLASM becomes not just a carrier of information, but also an object with which user is supposed to actively interact. A physical copy of the Our.v album "A U K" is a jar that contains a pendant for user. Inside the jar is a pendant in a form of a pill. Its owner can use the pendant as an accessory, as well as an item that has a digital extension. Each item is assigned a unique code. The jar contains an NFC tag, which the user scans and receives:

1. Archive with all album tracks + 4 bonus tracks
2. Stems archive of all the tracks for remixing. 
3. Access to the Telegram-bot that shares additional content from the collective.
