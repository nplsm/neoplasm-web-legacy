Oleksii Podat (aka “Aleksei Podat”, “AAAAA”, ex-CHSZM) is Sloviansk born (1996) music composer and performer. His music tool is melodic noise that helps him build an unstructured, yet harmonic composition. He uses multiple textures of raw droning chapters, that go on circles, loop and bleed into each other — just to collapse later and go drastically up or down. It resembles some feverish suite that plays in your ears whilst sleep paralysis. The most consistent quality that you can trace in his music will be avoidance of creative repetition and desire to express himself, as wildly and sincere as possible. In a playful manner, he explores the contrast between softness and harshness in a melody. 

As an artist, Oleksii have deepen into such themes as neo-colonialism, social anxiety, social media, the theory of addiction, personal struggle of substance abuse and love life.
